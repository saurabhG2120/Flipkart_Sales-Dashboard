🚀 Excited to share my recent Power BI Dashboard: Flipkart Sales Report! 📊

This dashboard provides key insights into sales performance, categorized across multiple dimensions like product categories, payment methods, and regions. Key highlights include:

🔹 Total Sales: A whopping 10M with an average sale of 10.08K
🔹 Total Quantity Sold: 4924 units across diverse categories
🔹 Sales by Product Category: Groceries, Electronics, and Fashion leading the pack 📈
🔹 Sales by Region: North and West India contributed the most
🔹 Payment Methods: Credit cards dominate, but there’s healthy competition from UPI and Debit Cards 💳
🔹 Yearly Trend: A drop in sales from 2023 to 2024 – strategic analysis is needed!

🛠️ Detailed Category Analysis:
I’ve included metrics like total orders received, quantity sold, sales amount, customer ratings, and discounts. This gives stakeholders a clear picture of performance and growth areas.

Visual storytelling is critical for data-driven decisions, and this report brings that vision to life. Can’t wait to continue refining these insights for even greater value!
